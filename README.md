# Hi Tatiana & Ivan



Please do the following:

## Get a train to Chantilly



## Meet me at the station



## Go to the garden



## Go via the library



## Go to the restaurant



## Back to the train station



## Taking a taxi

Unless you have way too much money, don't.

The road between Paris and Chantilly is very poor -- quite possibly this is by design! It takes much, much longer to come here by car than by train.
